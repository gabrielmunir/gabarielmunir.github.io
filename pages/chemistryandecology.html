        <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
        <h2>Species Diversity</h2>
        <p>Most specied are Prokaryotes (single-cell organisms without nucleus), the rest are Prokaryotes, which are single cell organisms with nucelus, and multi-cell organisms.</p>
        <p>about 60% of multicellular organisms are insects.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to distinguish single cell organisms that reproduce by division only into species.</p>
		<h3>Biodiversity Hotspots</h3>
		<p>2.3% of of landmass is considered as biodiversity hotspots.</p>
		<p>They contain:</p>
		<li>75% of bird, fish, and amphibion species.</li>
		<li>50% of plant species.</li>
		<li>42% of mammal species.</li>
		<p>Rivers & flood plains are considered a good example of biodiversity hotspots as they compromise 0.1% of earths surface area, but contain 9.5% of all species.</p>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Biodiversity Patterns</h2>
		<p>L = Local Biodiversity, R = Regional Biodiversity</p>
		<li>L Warm Temperature</li>
		<li>L Availability of Water</li>
		<li>L Stable Environmental Conditions</li>
		<li>L Predictable Enviromental Conditions</li>
		<li>R Large Habitat Diversity</li>
		<li>R Landscape Fragmentation</li>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Basic Biocenotic Principles</h2>
    	<p>Biocenology: A branch of biology concerned with the study of natural communities and the interactions between the members of said community.</p>
		<h3>The 3 Principles of Biocenology:</h3>
		<li>The more varied the living conditions in the biotope, the greater the number of species in the associated biogenesis, but, low number of individuals per species. A large number of ecological niches means large number of species. However, due to overall limitation of resources, small numbers of individuals per species.</li>
		<h3>The more homogenous the living conditions, the poorer the biogenesis is in terms of species. However, the few species that do exist occur in high numbers of individual. This is due to the unfavourable environmental conditions for the majority of species. Thus the few species that do exist have lots of resources to work with and occur in high numbers of individuals.</h3>
