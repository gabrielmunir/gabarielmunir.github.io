        <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
        <h2>Species Diversity</h2>
        <p>Most specied are Prokaryotes (single-cell organisms without nucleus), the rest are Prokaryotes, which are single cell organisms with nucelus, and multi-cell organisms.</p>
        <p>about 60% of multicellular organisms are insects.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to distinguish single cell organisms that reproduce by division only into species.</p>
		<h3>Biodiversity Hotspots</h3>
		<p>2.3% of of landmass is considered as biodiversity hotspots.</p>
		<p>They contain:</p>
		<li>75% of bird, fish, and amphibion species.</li>
		<li>50% of plant species.</li>
		<li>42% of mammal species.</li>
		<p>Rivers & flood plains are considered a good example of biodiversity hotspots as they compromise 0.1% of earths surface area, but contain 9.5% of all species.</p>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Biodiversity Patterns</h2>
		<p>L = Local Biodiversity, R = Regional Biodiversity</p>
		<li>L Warm Temperature</li>
		<li>L Availability of Water</li>
		<li>L Stable Environmental Conditions</li>
		<li>L Predictable Enviromental Conditions</li>
		<li>R Large Habitat Diversity</li>
		<li>R Landscape Fragmentation</li>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Basic Biocenotic Principles</h2>
    	<p>Biocenology: A branch of biology concerned with the study of natural communities and the interactions between the members of said community.</p>
		<h3>The 3 Principles of Biocenology:</h3>
		<li>The more varied the living conditions in the biotope, the greater the number of species in the associated biogenesis, but, low number of individuals per species. A large number of ecological niches means large number of species. However, due to overall limitation of resources, small numbers of individuals per species.</li>
		<li>The more homogenous the living conditions, the poorer the biogenesis is in terms of species. However, the few species that do exist occur in high numbers of individual. This is due to the unfavourable environmental conditions for the majority of species. Thus the few species that do exist have lots of resources to work with and occur in high numbers of individuals.</li>
		<li>The longer the similar environmental conditions have existed, the more species rich is its biogenesis & the more balances and stable it is. Long development time in stable conditions lead to low levels of extinction rates at relatively low invation & speciation rates, and thus an overall increase in species richness. Also, high level of redunduncy between species ensures ecological functioning even if some species go extinct.</li>
		<h3>Ecosystem Diversity</h3>
		<li>not all species that may occur in one ecosystem throughout its successional pathway do so simultaneously.</li>
		<li>Ecosystems may have completely different ecological properties and functioning according to the dominance patterns of individual species, even if the same set of species exist elsewhere.</li>
		<p>In an ecosystem, there are species in competition, faciliation, and in interaction with the abiotic environment. This leads to emergent effects bases on the interactive nature of the ecosystem. An important example is water retention capacity.</p>
		<h3>Genetic Diversity</h3>
		<p>Large variability in the gene pool allows for a larger adaptation potential in the case changes in the ecosystem.</p>
