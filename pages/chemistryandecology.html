        <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
        <h2>Species Diversity</h2>
        <p>Most specied are Prokaryotes (single-cell organisms without nucleus), the rest are Prokaryotes, which are single cell organisms with nucelus, and multi-cell organisms.</p>
        <p>about 60% of multicellular organisms are insects.</p>
		<p>It is difficult to distinguish single cell organisms that reproduce by division only into species.</p>
		<h3>Biodiversity Hotspots</h3>
		<p>2.3% of of landmass is considered as biodiversity hotspots.</p>
		<p>They contain:</p>
		<li>75% of bird, fish, and amphibion species.</li>
		<li>50% of plant species.</li>
		<li>42% of mammal species.</li>
		<p>Rivers & flood plains are considered a good example of biodiversity hotspots as they compromise 0.1% of earths surface area, but contain 9.5% of all species.</p>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Biodiversity Patterns</h2>
		<p>L = Local Biodiversity, R = Regional Biodiversity</p>
		<li>L Warm Temperature</li>
		<li>L Availability of Water</li>
		<li>L Stable Environmental Conditions</li>
		<li>L Predictable Enviromental Conditions</li>
		<li>R Large Habitat Diversity</li>
		<li>R Landscape Fragmentation</li>
		<h2>Species Diversity - Basic Biocenotic Principles</h2>
    	<p>Biocenology: A branch of biology concerned with the study of natural communities and the interactions between the members of said community.</p>
		<h3>The 3 Principles of Biocenology:</h3>
		<li>The more varied the living conditions in the biotope, the greater the number of species in the associated biogenesis, but, low number of individuals per species. A large number of ecological niches means large number of species. However, due to overall limitation of resources, small numbers of individuals per species.</li>
		<li>The more homogenous the living conditions, the poorer the biogenesis is in terms of species. However, the few species that do exist occur in high numbers of individual. This is due to the unfavourable environmental conditions for the majority of species. Thus the few species that do exist have lots of resources to work with and occur in high numbers of individuals.</li>
		<li>The longer the similar environmental conditions have existed, the more species rich is its biogenesis & the more balances and stable it is. Long development time in stable conditions lead to low levels of extinction rates at relatively low invation & speciation rates, and thus an overall increase in species richness. Also, high level of redunduncy between species ensures ecological functioning even if some species go extinct.</li>
		<h3>Ecosystem Diversity</h3>
		<li>not all species that may occur in one ecosystem throughout its successional pathway do so simultaneously.Ecos</li>
		<li>Ecosystems may have completely different ecological properties and functioning according to the dominance patterns of individual species, even if the same set of species exist elsewhere.</li>
		<p>In an ecosystem, there are species in competition, faciliation, and in interaction with the abiotic environment. This leads to emergent effects bases on the interactive nature of the ecosystem. An important example is water retention capacity.</p>
		<h3>Genetic Diversity</h3>
		<p>Large variability in the gene pool allows for a larger adaptation potential in the case changes in the ecosystem.</p>
		<h3>Why is Bidiversity important?</h3>
		<p>Biodiversity secures ecosystem services. Dividend of healthy ecosystem, which is permanently available to people for free. The following is the classification of said services with some examples.</p>
		<h4>Provisioning</h4>
		<p>Food, Fresh Water, Fuelwood, Fibers,  and Biochemicals.</p>
		<h4>Regulating</h4>
		<p>Climate, Disease, Water, and Pollution.</p>
		<h4>Cultural</h4>
		<p>Spiritual and Religous, Recreation, Ecotourism, Educational, and Cultural Heritage.</p>
		<h3>Global Valuation</h3>
		<p>Value of ecosystems provide golabbly each year is aprox. 124-145 Trilion US$ which is twice as much as the global GDP. Poor people are the most affected by the biodiversity loss as they cannot afford substitutes.</p>
		<p>Criticism of Global Valuation:</p>
		<li>Interesting but useless, decisions are not made at the global level.</li>
		<li>No objective evaluation, as there are latge differences between methods.</li>
		<li>Monetaroy evaluations are incomplete.</li>
		<li>Pricing leads to the comercialization which leads to privatization. (Editor note: Is this a bad thing if the comercialization is regulated ethically?)</li>
		<h3>State of Biodiversity</h3>
		<h4>Biodiversity loss:</h4>
		<li>Decrease in population sizes.</li>
		<li>Reduction in the distribution area.</li>
		<li>Thinning of suitable habitats in the range that species can use.</li>
		<li>Reduction of intraspecific genetic diversity.</li>
		<h4>Living Planet Index</h4>
		<p>LPI = Average percentage change in population size of vertebrates.</p>
		<h4>Species diversity in flowing waters:</h4>
		<p>Moderate warming over the past 25 years lead to the reorgnization of stream invertebrate communites. +36% Population & +40% Species richness.</p>
		<p>Shift in the ratio of warm & cold loving species mainly uphill, but hardly northward. Also, the compensation opportunites end when species have reached headwaters and springs, as they follow the water upstream.</p>
		<h3>5 Main Causes of Biodiversity Loss</h3>
		<h4>Habitat Loss</h4>
		<p>In Germany, 52 ha/day for settlement & transport.</p>
		<h4>Overuse</h4>
		<p>Overhunting and overfishing which leads to the rise of the slime.</p>
		<h4>Invasive Species</h4>
		<p>Introduction of already common tolerant species by humans into new environments that displace endemic, specialized species.</p>
		<h4>Pollution</h4>
		<p>Air (Fine particles, Ozone, NOx, SOx), Water (Hormones, Salt), Agriculture (Nitrate, Pesticides), and Waste (PCB, Microplastics, Heavy Metals).</p>
		<h4>Climate Change</h4>
		<p>Species must shift range in order to remain within their cimate tolerance range.</p>
		<li>Extention to the north or retreat in the south.</li>
		<li>Shift to higher altitudes.</li>
		<p>Shift is not possible everywhere, and thus leads to Fragmentation of the landscape (Ex. Roads and Barriers).</p>
		<p>Possibilty of niche dissolution due to divergent shifts in environmental factors.</p>
		<h4>Ecological Mismatches</h4>
		<p>Evolutionary coordination processes no longer occur simultaneously.</p>
